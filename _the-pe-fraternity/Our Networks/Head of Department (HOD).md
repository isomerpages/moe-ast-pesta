The PE Head of Department (HOD) Network was conceptualized in 2019 and it serves as a vehicle to drive the efficacy of the HOD’s Curriculum Leadership. The three main drivers leading to the professional development of PE HODs are:

*   Designing, implementing, assessing curriculum and instruction;
*   Advocating for health and physical education within school and community; and
*   Developmental supervision.

**Objectives:**

*   To look into the professional development needs of PE HOD;
*   To provide platforms for the PE HOD to share information, ideas and best practices; and
*   To provide platforms for PE HOD to network and build stronger relationships.  
    

The PE HOD Network held its inaugural meeting on 4 July 2019 with 128 PE HOD attending one of three breakout sessions as follows:

*   Departmental Supervision and Development, and Using Data to Inform Planning;
*   Formative Assessment; and
*   Effective Teaching Strategies (Making Thinking Visible)
