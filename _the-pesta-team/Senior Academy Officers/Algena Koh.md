<h4>Algena Koh (Senior Academy Officer)</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Prior to joining AST, Algena has been with CHIJ Katong Convent Secondary for 16 years where she served as HOD for Student Development and SH Discipline. Her earlier teaching stint was in St Patrickâ€™s School for 7 years.</p><p>Algena<strong> </strong>believes that a skilful educator builds good relationships with her students based on mutual respect and trust, and sets the tone for a classroom community. Good communication and genuine care are essential for students to have a trusting relationship with the teacher. A teacher must also have clear expectations of his/her class and communicate this effectively. In addition, one must always be willing to learn, reflect and adapt.</p><p>Algena loves to play netball in her free time. She is still currently playing with her club which she joined since she was 17 years of age. She also enjoys being by the beach as well as cooking for her family.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
