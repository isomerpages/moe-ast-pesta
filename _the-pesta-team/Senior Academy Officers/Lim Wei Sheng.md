Mr Lim Wei Sheng joined the teaching service in 2015 in Da Qiao Primary School and served as Subject Head/ CCA & Aesthetics in Jing Shan Primary School when the two schools merged in 2019. He was awarded the Singapore Physical Education Association (SPEA) Book Prize in 2013 and was a finalist of the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) in 2019. A highlight of his leadership journey was to lead in the design and implementation of Jing Shan’s Design and Maker Education programme, earning the recognition for the school as ETD’s South Zone Maker Education Lead School in 2020.<br><br>

Wei Sheng pursues his craft of teaching as a lifetime art and the purpose of education as a lifelong endeavour. He is greatly influenced by the work of Fred Rogers. As an educator, Wei Sheng aspires to use PE for each child to build their values, character and sense of identity. His areas of interest in PE include e-pedagogy, games-based approaches, and using student-generated questions to deepen learning. He also believes strongly in the power of people and their inherent potential for growth. Wei Sheng was a beneficiary of PESTA’s Beginning PE Teacher (BPET) network, and now hopes to pay it forward by supporting BPETs and fellow PE colleagues in their professional growth.</p>
