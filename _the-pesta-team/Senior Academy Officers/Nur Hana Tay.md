<h5>Nur Hana Tay (Academy Officer)</h5><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DSC_0181.JPG"></div><p>Nur Hana started teaching PE and Math in Yumin Primary School from 1999 to 2001. Subsequently she taught in Jurong West Primary School from 2002 to 2008 where she was internally appointed as the Subject Head for NE&nbsp; / SS. In 2017, she was appointed as the Senior Teacher for PE in West Grove Pri School.<br><br></p><p>Since her appointment as a Senior Teacher, she has led a team of QPETs in reviewing the school’s PE SOW, pedagogical and assessment practices to optimise student learning and engagement. Nur Hana believes that every student wants to and can learn when given the appropriate learning experiences, together with a positive and supportive environment. Nur Hana was also involved in learning teams and professional development collaborations within the school, cluster and zonal level. Together with the W3 PE Support group, she charted and planned the professional learning directions for W3’s PE teachers, through the Network Learning Communities (NLC).<br><br></p><p>Nur Hana firmly believes that when teams of teachers from different schools come together to learn collaboratively and reflect on their teaching practices, the PE community will flourish and continually renew itself. Nur Hana also believes that mentorship is important because it accelerates the development of new teachers and provides teachers with the opportunity to develop and become more competent in their roles.</p><p></p>
