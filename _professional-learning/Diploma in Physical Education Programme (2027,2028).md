<h3><strong>Diploma in Physical Education (In-Service) Programme 2027/2028</strong></h3>
<h4>(Applications open in January 2026)</h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Diploma in Physical Education (In-Service) Programme aims to
develop professional competency and expertise in non-PE teachers for teaching
Physical Education (PE) at Primary and Secondary levels. The programme
will be conducted over two three-month periods in Term 1 2027 and 2028,
with a five-week Teaching Practice (TP) in Term 3 2028.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the programme, participants will be recognised
as Qualified PE Teachers (QPETs). Their Subject Proficiency 1 will be updated
to PE, and they will be deployed to teach PE in their existing schools
according to current HR Group guidelines.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that applications can only be supported if officers are not
teaching Subject Areas of Need (SAN) or niche subjects, due to existing
staffing requirements. The programme's commencement is subject to meeting
the minimum number of participants required by NIE.</p>
