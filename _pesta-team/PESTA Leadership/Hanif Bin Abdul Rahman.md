<p>Hanif Abdul Rahman was appointed the first Principal Master Teacher for
Physical Education (PE) at the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy
(PESTA) in 2018, after pioneering the role of Singapore’s first PE Master
Teacher in 2013. In these capacities, he has shaped the professional development
landscape for PE teachers nationwide, building a strong fraternity anchored
in purpose, innovation, and care.</p>
<p>At PESTA, Hanif conceptualises and drives professional learning for diverse
teacher profiles, conducts workshops and school consultations, and facilitates
networked learning. He is also a curriculum writer for the Singapore PE
Syllabus, with a special focus on the affective domain and the development
of 21st Century Competencies. His current research and practice explore
cognitive functions and the codification of thinking processes in PE, extending
his long-standing discourse on how movement education nurtures both character
and intellect. His thought leadership has been shared widely through international
presentations and guest lectures on affective and cognitive development.</p>
<p>Guided by his professional philosophy of <em>“Engage and Create,”</em> Hanif
advocates a constructivist approach to learning – believing deeply in engaging
learners meaningfully while creating opportunities for others to thrive.
Across nearly 30 years of service, he has taught in mainstream and independent
schools, and held key leadership roles as Head of Department and Vice-Principal.
Beyond PESTA, he contributes actively to cross-division workgroups in the
MOE and strengthens the mentoring fraternity at large as a Mentor Coach
at the Academy of Singapore Teachers.</p>
<p>Hanif’s journey is also rooted in sport. A former Singapore national rugby
player, coach of the Combined Schools team, and international referee,
he embodies the values of discipline, resilience, and teamwork that PE
seeks to cultivate. His contributions on and off the field have been recognised
with induction into the Singapore Olympic Academy Roll of Honour (2012),
the Public Administration Medal (Bronze) (2017), and an Honorary Doctorate
(PhD) in Sports Sociology by Kennedy University, France (2025). He is also
currently pursuing an Educational Doctorate (EdD) with a focus on mentoring,
continuing his quest to explore how teachers grow as both leaders and learners.</p>
<p>For Hanif, PE is more than movement – it is a platform to engage the head,
heart, and hand. It is his conviction that through PE, teachers can inspire
students not only to be stronger in body, but also more resilient in spirit,
and more thoughtful in mind.</p>
