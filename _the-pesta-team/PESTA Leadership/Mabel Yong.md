<p style="text-align:justify">
Ms Mabel Yong Chooi Cheng started her teaching career in 1992 teaching PE in primary schools, and has served as Head of Department for 17 years. She joined the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) as a Programme Manager in 2012 and was subsequently appointed Lead Teacher/Physical Education and Master Teacher/Physical Education in 2014 and 2016 respectively.<br><br>

Her main role in PESTA is to support the North West Zone schools in delivering the Teaching and Learning PE Curriculum through teaching attachment to schools and consultation work. Mabel is also the lead facilitator for several workshops on topics such as Curriculum Design and Assessment, Dance and Gymnastics in PE. She is also involved in creating and designing teaching resources used in schools to facilitate students’ joy of learning and creativity.<br><br>  

An advocate of equal opportunity to quality learning experience for everyone, Mabel constantly seeks ways to tease out the individual’s sense of purpose and direction in what is done. Her personal professional statement is “Success through Competence”.<br><br>
	
Mabel builds on the motivation and ability of the individuals through empowering them with knowledge, skills and/ or attitudes to deal with the challenges faced at the point of time. Trust that everyone wants to do well and celebrate little successes - “Happy teachers make happy students”.<br><br>

She is also a strong believer that a change in behaviour must begin with the change in thinking. Thus it is important to show, not just tell. For example: during school support programmes, being able to demonstrate how PE lessons and programmes can be better planned and delivered effectively usually results in teachers’ change in behaviour to become more reflective and attempt approaches new to them.</p>
