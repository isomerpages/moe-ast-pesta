**Objectives:**

*   Raise awareness and actualisation of the roles of TLs, ie, Pedagogical Leader, Mentor & Collaborator;
*   Deepen professional knowledge through networking; and
*   Build networked learning communities (NLC).

In 2016, the TL Network Core Team (CT) was formed, consisting of Master, Lead and selected Senior Teachers. Its role is to:

*   Chart and plan the professional learning directions for PE TL Network;
*   Conduct and facilitate professional development sessions (ie, workshop, sharing sessions, etc) for TLs;
*   Propagate good and innovative teaching practices through cluster and zonal schools; and
*   Spearhead NLCs for special interest groups with TLs.

Led by PESTA, the TL Network currently meet centrally as a big group in Term 1 to set the learning direction for the year.  This is then followed by a zonal network session each in Term 2 and 3, led by the zonal CT members. The big group will meet again centrally in Term 4 to share and celebrate the learning for the year.
