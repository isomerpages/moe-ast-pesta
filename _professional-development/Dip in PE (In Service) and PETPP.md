####  2024 Physical Education Teacher Practitioner Programme (PETPP) - Application open till 1 Sep 2023!

The PE Teacher Practitioner Programme (PETPP) was introduced in 2021 to alleviate the short-term shortage of QPETs at the primary level. It equips non-Qualified Physical Education Teachers with requisite knowledge and skills to conduct PE lessons that meet curricular objectives safely. The PETPP has replaced the former “Introduction to Basics of Teaching Physical Education” (IBTPE) as the mandatory PD for non-QPETs who are intending and/or will be deployed to teach PE at the primary level.

From 2023, non-QPETs can only teach PE after completing the PETPP. The PETPP consists of a total of 9 modules. Two modules are conducted by National Institute of Education-Physical Education and Sports Science (NIE-PESS) (2 x 3 full-day sessions) and 7 are conducted by PESTA/PSOEB (1 x full-day sessions and 6 x half-day sessions). All modules will be conducted at Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), except for a half day school experience where teachers get to observe PE lessons from the different learning areas. 

Education Officers (EOs) who complete the PETPP will gain exemptions for two modules should they choose to enrol into the Diploma in PE (in-service) after the PETPP. The exemptions will have a validity of 5 years.

**Commitment (Jan 2024 – April 2024)**

* Full Day - 7 sessions
* Half Day - 6 sessions
* All Sessions will be on Wednesday. 

**Criteria**

*   Non\-PE trained Education Officers (EOs) who are intending and/or will be deployed to teach PE from Semester 2, 2024

All applications must be endorsed by the School Leader (SL) before submission. Arrangements will be made by PESTA for applicants to attend a medical examination by a medical doctor once applications have been processed. Upon medical clearance, applicants who are successful for the PETPP will be informed by PESTA by the end of November.

We look forward to your continued support for current non-QPETs to pursue their passion in teaching PE. Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact the following PESTA/PSOEB Officers:
