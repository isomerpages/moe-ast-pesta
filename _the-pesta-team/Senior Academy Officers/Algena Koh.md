<p><strong>Algena Koh</strong><br>Senior Academy Officer (PESTA)</p><p>Prior to joining AST, Algena has been with CHIJ Katong Convent Secondary for 16 years. She has served as HOD Student Development and SH Discipline in KC. Prior to KC, she was teaching in St Patrickâ€™s school for 7 years.</p><p>Algena<strong> </strong>believes that a skilful educator builds good relationships with her students based on mutual respect and trust and sets the tone for a classroom community. Good communication and genuine care are keys for students to be open and vulnerable to a teacher. The teacher must also have clear expectations of the class and communicate that effectively. Always be willing to learn from students and be open an open book as well.&nbsp; Being a reflective educator helps keep her on her toes to constantly adapt, modify, learn and relearn.</p><p>Algena loves to play netball in her free time. She is still currently playing with her club which she joined since she was 17 years of age. She also enjoys lazing by the beach and cooking for her famil<em>y.</em></p>
