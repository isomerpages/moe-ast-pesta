Linus started his teaching career in Seng Kang Secondary School in 2014. During his time in Seng Kang Secondary, he was given the opportunity to spearhead various programmes. He developed the Healthy Lifestyle Programme in school aimed at increasing participation in physical activities for overweight students. The programme also creates a platform for all students to come together to develop friendship and bonds through games.<br><br>

Linus believes in making PE lessons engaging and fun. He developed the Outdoor Education Programme to integrate interesting lesson packages such as infusing the use of ICT in Orienteering and crafting delightful recipes for Outdoor Cooking. He subsequently moved on to Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) as the Subject Head of CCA and Student Leadership. In his time with CGSS, he explored various ways to increase students’ motivation in PE as he believes that highly motivated students will lead to increased engagement and learning. He made use of various ICT platforms and tools such as Google Classrooms and Plickers to chart students’ progress and learning. He also conducted surveys and engaged the students with conversations to further understand their needs and wants in PE.<br><br>

Linus is a strong believer of using PE as a platform to develop self-confidence. He is a strong advocate of the Self Determination Theory and has used that as a fundamental towards making PE lessons more engaging and meaningful. Linus looks forward to continue striving to develop highly motivated students with joy and passion in PE.</p>
