<h5>Diana Goh Luan En (Lead Manager)</h5><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Diana_2.JPG"></div><p>Diana Goh joined PESTA in 2015 and it has been a very fulfilling journey for her. Having worked in the private sectors prior to joining the Ministry, Diana counts herself extremely blessed to be able to work with selfless colleagues who are always ready to provide valuable advices and lend her a helping hand. Being an active person who still plays in local hockey competitions, she has picked up many useful pointers on food nutrition, fitness and health tips from her colleagues. A mother to three young children, it also means that she understands the importance of multitasking and efficiency, something which she exhibits in her work capacity of timely facilitation of professional development opportunities for the PE fraternity via the planning and publicity of workshops in various platforms, answering of enquiries (via emails, tele-conversation and in person no less!) and supporting the team in financial and administrative duties.</p><p>She is constantly inspired and in awe of the effort, passion and dedication that her fellow colleagues have put into their work as a teaching professional. She also personally believes in going the extra mile in her line of duty to ensure that each teacher receives conducive training environment from the very start to the end of a workshop.</p><p>Outside of work, she is contented with the simpler things in life, such as spending quality time outdoors with her loved ones and taking time to appreciate the nature and animals around her.</p><p></p>
