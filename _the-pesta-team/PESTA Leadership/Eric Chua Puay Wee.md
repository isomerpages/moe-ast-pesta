Prior to joining MOE, Eric worked in SAFRA as a Sports Executive where he was involved in planning and organising sports programmes, club management and development.&nbsp; His passion in sports and working with youth led him to join the ministry in 2000 as a PE teacher.&nbsp; He started his career in CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent, before joining Meridian JC where he took on the responsibility of SH Sports and subsequently HOD CCA.&nbsp; He was appointed as a Vice-Principal in 2013 and served in Holy Innocents High School and Queenstown Secondary School.  

Eric believes in the unique worth of the individual, the enhancement of his well-being and the symbiotic relations between him and society.&nbsp; He strongly believes that every child wants to and can learn.&nbsp; Physical education is a vital component of students’ schooling experience which enables them to be active and physically competent individuals.&nbsp; It contributes to their holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare each individual to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.&nbsp;  

In his free time, Eric loves to swim and cycle.&nbsp; His weekly cycling regime covers over 100km at the dedicated cycling lane at Tanah Merah Coastal Road and around Singapore.&nbsp; He also enjoys playing basketball and all racket games.  

At PESTA, Eric seeks to learn and work with the esteemed team of Teacher Leaders in building a distinctive community of physical education teachers to deliver quality physical education and sports coaching in Singapore schools and making a difference in the lives of students.
