### Open Resource Sharing

Place holder for write up on what is PESTA's open resource sharing is about. 

Rough write up (extracted from Hanif's email to ITD and from our notes of meeting):

*   PESTA intends to share our Teaching and Learning resources (e.g., workshop slides, media, notes and other resource handouts), and other curated openly-available resources on the internet, with the PE teachers fraternity. 
    
*   In addition to accessibility to MOE teachers, we are also open to the global PE fraternity accessing and using these resources. This will create an opportunity for networking with overseas partners.
