###  2025 Diploma in PE (In-Service) Programme
##### (Application Closed) 

The Diploma in Physical Education (In-Service) Programme seeks to develop professional competency and expertise on non-PE teachers in the teaching of PE. We are pleased to inform you that for the coming 2025/2026 intake, we are offering the programme as dual level training for Primary and Secondary levels. 

Given staffing needs for some subjects, applications can only be supported if officers are not teaching Subject Areas of Need (SAN) or niche subjects.  In addition, Sec teachers will also remain at their current level to teach PE upon course completion.

This programme will be conducted over two three-month periods and a five-week Teaching Practice (TP) in 2025 and 2026.

Upon successful completion of the programme, these officers will be considered Qualified PE Teachers (QPETs). Their Subject Proficiency 1 will be changed to PE and will be deployed according to current HR Group's guidelines. 
      
Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact Mr Muhammad Hafiz (Senior Manager/PESTA) at Muhammad_Hafiz_Maarof@moe.gov.sg.

Please note that completed forms must be submitted to above email by 15 April 2025 and that conduct of the programme is subjected to the minimum number of participants required by NIE.  


###  2024 Physical Education Teacher Practitioner Programme (PETPP) 
##### (Application closed)

The PE Teacher Practitioner Programme (PETPP) was introduced in 2021 to alleviate the short-term shortage of QPETs at the primary level. It equips non-Qualified Physical Education Teachers with requisite knowledge and skills to conduct PE lessons that meet curricular objectives safely. The PETPP has replaced the former “Introduction to Basics of Teaching Physical Education” (IBTPE) as the mandatory PD for non-QPETs who are intending and/or will be deployed to teach PE at the primary level.

From 2023, non-QPETs can only teach PE after completing the PETPP. The PETPP consists of a total of 9 modules. Two modules are conducted by National Institute of Education-Physical Education and Sports Science (NIE-PESS) (2 x 3 full-day sessions) and 7 are conducted by PESTA/PSOEB (1 x full-day sessions and 6 x half-day sessions). All modules will be conducted at Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), except for a half day school experience where teachers get to observe PE lessons from the different learning areas. 

Education Officers (EOs) who complete the PETPP will gain exemptions for two modules should they choose to enrol into the Diploma in PE (in-service) after the PETPP. The exemptions will have a validity of 5 years.

**Commitment (Jan 2024 – April 2024)**

* Full Day - 7 sessions
* Half Day - 6 sessions
* All Sessions will be on Wednesday. 

**Criteria**

*   Non\-PE trained Education Officers (EOs) who are intending and/or will be deployed to teach PE from Semester 2, 2024

Arrangements will be made by PESTA for applicants to attend a medical examination by a medical doctor once applications have been processed.

We look forward to your continued support for current non-QPETs to pursue their passion in teaching PE. Should you have any queries, please feel free to contact the following PESTA/PSOEB Officers:
