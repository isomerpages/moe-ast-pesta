The late Dr Tan Eng Yoon was well known as an athlete, teacher, coach and administrator.   
  
After obtaining his diploma at the Teacher's Training College (TTC), Dr Tan received a scholarship in 1955 to study Physical Education (PE) at Loughborough College. Dr Tan also obtained a Masters of Sports Science Degree from the United Sports Academy in 1986. Thereafter, he received the Honorary doctorate (Honoris Causa) from Loughborough University in 2005 for his contributions in the public service and the development of sports in Singapore.  
  
A keen sportsman, Dr Tan enjoyed a competitive sports career in Singapore from 1947 - 1962. Driven by his passion for the sport and the desire to help young athletes with the potential to succeed, he became a National Track and Field coach between 1958 and 1970s. He spotted and groomed many top national athletes such as Glory Barnabas, Nirza Namazie, Osman Merician and C. Kunalan. In 2002, Mr Kunalan was inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame and attributed his success to Dr Tan Eng Yoon.  
  
Tan devoted himself to coaching and administration in sport. He was appointed as Singapore Honorary National Coach until 1970, and helped to set up coaching and officiating schemes. He continued coaching with innovative techniques and was a visionary leader in sports administration. After the Games, he helped to set up the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and was its Deputy Executive Director until his retirement in 1988. From 1976 to 1988, he was Chairman of the SSC's Coaching Committee. He also helped to establish the Milo Training Scheme for young footballers in 1974, staying involved in the scheme for the next 14 years.  

Dr Tan was the Director of the National Stadium Corporation that oversaw the construction of the National Stadium. In 1973, he helped to establish Singapore Sports Council and served as Deputy Executive Director until he retired in 1988. He remained active in the sports scene after his retirement and served as the General--Secretary of the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) from 1963 - 1988. In 2009, Dr Tan was voted as the President of Singapore Olympians Association, which he had played a key role in setting up. In 2010, he realised one of his dreams when he envisioned the first ever Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in Singapore.

Dr Tan was also an established athlete in his own right. He represented the country at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics in the triple jump and 100-metre sprint. In 1959, he won Singapore's first medal, in the 400-metre hurdles, at the inaugural South-East Asian Peninsular Games, the pre-cursor to the present-day SEA Games. He also won the triple jump gold and his national record for this event stood for 32 years.  
  
When the first SEAP Games (later known as the SEA Games) were held in 1959, Dr Tan was captain of the Singapore contingent in Bangkok. He achieved the distinction of winning Singapore's first gold medal at the Games, in the 400m hurdles, shortly before weightlifter Tan Howe Liang won his gold medal. Dr Tan's feat marked the first time Singapore's flag was raised and the anthem played at a sporting competition in a foreign country. By the end of the SEAP Games, Tan had won another gold in the triple jump and a bronze in the 110m hurdles. At the following SEAP Games in 1961, Dr Tan retained his triple jump gold and won a silver medal with the 4x100 metres relay team. He retired from competitive athletics in 1962 to concentrate on coaching.

*   **The Educator, The Athlete**  
    

Dr Tan Eng Yoon is an eminent national coaching athlete. He is an athlete himself and has gone through the mill. He has gone through competition and has lost, and won many times. This is invaluable because he knows what it's like to strive and to struggle. These are meaningful components of a good lecturer in Physical Education; components that Tan Eng Yoon have.

*   **The Coach Who "Turned On The Wiper"**

Dr Tan Eng Yoon has a special place in my heart - no, actually more than my heart - in my whole life, from the time i met him in 1963 till the last meeting I worked with him in the Singapore Olympians Association in January 2010.  
  
‪In all these years, I have known Dr Tan as one with a conscience - the attribute that makes one live with honesty and integrity. When he was a coach, he was always calm and cool, especially during moments of great tension during competitions. How calm was he - you may ask? Well, one day, I offered to give Dr Tan a ride in my car. The minute we got into the car, it began to pour. I could not see a thing! Panicking, I asked Dr Tan for advice. Calmly, he said, "Turn on the wiper".   
  
Dr Tan did more than turn on the wiper of my car. He turned on the wiper in my life so that I could see things more clearly. How grateful I am to Dr Tan Eng Yoon for being a wonderful mentor and role model.
