<p>PESTA aims to enrich the global repository of knowledge by offering sound
physical education (PE) resources, grounded in the exemplary standards
of the Singapore education system, the Singapore Physical Education Syllabus,
and the exceptional quality of workshops we conduct.</p>
<p>These resources will be disseminated through our <strong>P</strong>ESTA <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>We</strong>b <strong>R</strong>esource
(POWeR), a dedicated platform housed within the PESTA website and overseen
by our organization. POWeR is designed to be catering primarily to PE teachers
while remaining accessible to the broader public.</p>
<p>The resources, which center on the six prioritized areas of practice outlined
in SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd), are curated by PESTA to ensure relevance
and effectiveness.</p>
