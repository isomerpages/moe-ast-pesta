We believe that PE and Sports teachers are dedicated professionals. Effective professional development must be coherent and specific to ensure that learning has meaning and authenticity. To provide effective PD, we must be open-minded forward-thinkers and role models. We will actively engage the fraternity in the creation and consolidation of knowledge and skills. We will nurture the passion for continual learning in teachers through self-directed and collaborative opportunities
