<h3>Professional Learning Fiesta</h3>
<p>Held biennially, Professional Learning Fiesta is a platform for teachers
to share and connect, on top of affirming and celebrating the spirit of
professional learning amongst PE teachers. We value the wisdom of teachers
and encourage teachers to step forward to present and sign up to learn
from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PF 2024 was held from 26th August to 20th September 2024!</p>
