<p><strong><em>DAVID JAMES CHUA </em></strong>firmly believes in setting
a good example from which both students and colleagues can learn from.
In todayâ€™s information age, knowledge is easily accessible but good values
are hard to come by. It is our job as Educators to model values like the
Joy of Learning, Care for Others and even Growth Mindset. We cannot expect
students to be proficient in these if we do not show these values ourselves.</p>

<p><strong><em>DAVID JAMES CHUA </em></strong><em>loves to go to the gym, jog or do HIIT in his free time. He is an advocate for eating healthy and believes that gut is strongly linked with physical health. He is also a happy traveler and would get on a plane to another country anytime the opportunity arises.</em>
