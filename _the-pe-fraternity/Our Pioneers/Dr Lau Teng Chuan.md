Dr Lau Teng Chuan - a giant in the arena of Physical Education (PE) and Sports in Singapore.  
  
As a promising and highly capable PE teacher, Dr Lau was one of the first to receive an overseas education in PE teacher training at Loughborough in 1954. Dr Lau also received the Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) from Loughborough University in 2003 for his contribution to the public service and the development of sports in Singapore.  
  
Upon his return to Singapore from his studies in 1956, Dr Lau became a lecturer and the Head of Department of PE in the Teacher Training College (TTC). In 1973, Dr Lau obtained his Bachelors Degree with Honours from the University of Oregon, and earned his Masters soon after. Dr Lau returned to Singapore and held the post of Head of Department in the newly formed Institute of Education from 1973 - 1975.  
  
From 1975 - 1992, Dr Lau became the Executive Director of the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), and was central to the development of the SSC. He assisted the Government to shape and implement the strategy for PE and Sports in Singapore. He also represented Singapore on international committees. In 1995, Dr Lau was appointed Secretary General of the Singapore National Olympic Committee, and held the post with rare distinction. Dr Lau was also instrumental in initiating the annual series of PE Seminars, which served to bring PE teachers to update their knowledge in this field.  
  
Dr Lau persuaded the PE fraternity to form the Singapore Physical Education (PE) Association. He was the first President for the Singapore Physical Education Association (SPEA) from 1975 - 1992. To honour his contributions, SPEA started the ‘Lau Teng Chuan Professional Development Fund' and is one the biggest contributors to it.  
  
As a sportsman, Dr Lau excelled in badminton. He swept all before him on the badminton courts at Loughborough and at the British Universities championships. Dr Lau represented Singapore from 1956 - 58, and was the Republic's chief coach from 1963 - 65. He was even invited by the New Zealand Badminton Federation to be their Honorary Visiting Coach for a few months. Dr Lau was also the badminton referee at the Asian Games in China and Hiroshima, and at many other tournaments. Since 1988, Dr Lau was the Asian Continental Representative to the International Badminton Federation, as well as the Chairman of the International Badminton Umpires Federation. Dr Lau was also an avid sportsman in soccer. He was the Honorary Secretary of the Football Association of Singapore in 1982, and held the post for more than a decade.  
  
As a highly capable administrator, Dr Lau was awarded the Public Administration Award Bronze Medal for service to education in 1969. In 1981, he was also awarded the Public Administration Award Silver Medal for service to sport. In 1997, Dr Lau received the International Badminton Federation's Distinguished Service Award for his lifelong dedication to and support of the game of badminton.  
  
Dr Lau's colleagues described him as a man who carried out his work "in his own quiet, unobtrusive way". He was "firm" in his professional dealings with his staff, and "down to earth" at the same time.  
  
Dr Lau led by example and this influenced his staff as well. For instance, he would get down on his knees to scrub floors alongside his students when needed. Dr Lau believed that no job was too demeaning for him, and he always put the welfare of his students as priority. One of his students even named his first son "Teng Chuan".  
  
Dr Lau retired in 2002.  

Recollections of Dr Lau Teng Chuan by former PE students:  
------------------------------------------------------------

*   **A Teacher, Mentor and Friend**  
      
    Dr Lau has been my teacher, boss, mentor and friend. I first met him when I was a trainee teacher at the Teachers' Training College in 1961. Many of the PE teachers who graduated in the early 60s are grateful to him for shaping their lives and transforming them into successful athletes, teachers and sports administrators. Amongst them were Olympic athletes, successful teachers, school principals and administrators in the Ministry of Education and the Singapore Sports Council. Dr Lau is an inspiration to all of us.  
      
    Dr. Lau's contributions in education and sport are too numerous to mention in this short tribute to him. Having spent many years in the Teachers' Training College, Singapore Sports Council, National Olympic Council and the Management Committees of several National Sports Associations, Dr Lau has left a legacy that few can be proud to claim.   
      
    Besides these academic and professional contributions, Dr. Lau is well known to be a man of character. In the years that I have known him, I have not come across anyone who does not have something nice to say about him; even about his looks.  
      
    I am lucky and honoured to have been Dr Lau's student, colleague and friend.

*   **A Gentleman, Leader and Inspiration**  
      
    Dr Lau Teng Chuan - a true gentleman, a born leader and a good friend. Dr Lau's knowledge and understanding of sport is immeasurable, and he always strives for excellence in his work. Dr Lau has many qualities, and to me, his most outstanding one is his humility. He treats everyone, regardless of status, with deep respect.  
      
    I am fortunate to have had Dr Lau as an instructor at a six-month Badminton Coaching Course. His lectures and practical demonstrations were excellent. He helped me to improve my personal game, master the ‘backhand clear' and become a better coach.  
      
    I always felt that in spite being an administrator, Dr Lau was never too busy with his administrative work for us. He dedicated time to help our coaches and players, and was always there to guide and support all of us.  
      
    Thank you, Dr Lau, for being an inspiration.
