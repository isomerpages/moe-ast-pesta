<p>Here’s a polished website blurb you can drop in:</p>
<p>In this collection, Singapore’s PE fraternity offers a heartfelt gift
to the nation—a celebration of how lessons taught, games played, and students
believed in can shape lives and leave a lasting legacy. Told through six
themed chapters, the book journeys from the field to the heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mission: United for Glory</strong> — the unifying spirit of
sport, playing for something bigger than ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Legends: Heroes Among Us</strong> — teachers, coaches, and
students whose grit turns obstacles into opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Moments: Triumphs that Define</strong> — pivotal shots and
quiet breakthroughs that transform lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Identity: Strength in Diversity</strong> — how a multicultural
Singapore finds common ground in play and competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Lessons: Wisdom from the Field</strong> — resilience, teamwork,
and integrity carried beyond the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Legacy: Passing the Torch</strong> — honouring those who came
before and inspiring the next generation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re a teacher, student, parent, or athlete, these stories will
move you, challenge you, and invite you to share your own.
<br><strong>Let us continue to Lead, Care, and Inspire.</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>A Heartfelt Gift From,</strong>
<br><strong>PESTA</strong>
