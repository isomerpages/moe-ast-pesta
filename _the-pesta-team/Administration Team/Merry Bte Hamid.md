<h5>Merry Hamid (Executive)</h5><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Merry3.JPG"></div><p>Merry started her career with Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) previously known as Income Tax in 1978 which she was attached under the Anti-Evasion Unit. Working with professional officers, she was exposed with different areas of tasks. She then joined MOE in 1981 when Income Tax switched to private organisation. In mid Aug 1978, she started her journey in MOE that spanned 38 years. Over the years, she experienced various job scopes with different divisions/units. Working with different officers, colleagues and other general staff have given her wider knowledge of working styles. At Higher Education division (HED), she did finance as a purchasing officer, MCare (answering and replying interim application for admission to ITE, polys and universities) and other tasks. Having been in HED for 19 years, she decided to explore different job scopes.
