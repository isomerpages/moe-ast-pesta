The PESTA logo represents an athlete launching off from a starting position. This symbolises the birth of the Academy and a new take-off for the fraternity - the creation of a Home Base dedicated to the professional development of all Physical Education and Sports teachers.

The athlete is shaped by multi-coloured bands signifying the various components of physical education that the Academy seeks to promote. The fluid movement and dynamism of the bands represent the zeal and motivation of Physical Education teachers as they strive to improve themselves through their involvement in PESTA. The spaces between the bands symbolise the yet unexplored areas in Physical Education that PESTA will study and advance.  

The forward moving and energetic portrayal of the athlete exemplifies the spirit of an Academy that is progressive, vibrant and passionate; expressing the aspirations and dreams of the fraternity.
