<p>With over two decades of experience in sports and education, Eric brings
extensive expertise and passion to his leadership role at PESTA, which
he joined in 2023. Before joining the Ministry of Education(MOE), he worked
as a Sports Executive at SAFRA, where he was involved in planning and organising
sports programmes, club management, and development. His passion for sports
and working with youth led him to join MOE in 2000 as a Physical Education
(PE) teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric began his teaching career at CHIJ St Theresa's Convent before moving
to Meridian Junior College, where he took on the responsibilities of Subject
Head for Sports and subsequently Head of Department for Co-Curricular Activities.
In 2013, he was appointed as Vice-Principal and served at Holy Innocents
High School and Queenstown Secondary School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric believes firmly in the unique worth of every individual, the enhancement
of their well-being, and the symbiotic relationship between the individual
and society. He holds the conviction that every child wants to learn and
has the capacity to do so. For Eric, PE is a vital component of students'
schooling experience that enables them to become active and physically
competent individuals. It contributes to their holistic education and the
development of 21st Century Competencies, better preparing each student
to thrive in our fast-changing and highly-connected world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of work, Eric maintains an active lifestyle through swimming,
cycling, gym workouts, and pickleball. He is an advocate for ketogenic
diet and intermittent fastingâ€”a healthy lifestyle he has maintained for
over a decade, which has enabled him to lose over 10kg and drop 2 clothing
sizes. He now conducts talks and sharing sessions about his health journey,
inspiring others to embrace wellness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At PESTA, Eric works alongside his esteemed team of Master Teachers and
Academy officers, partnering with various stakeholders to cultivate a distinctive
community of PE teachers. Through their collective efforts, they deliver
quality professional learning opportunities for PE teachers and teacher
coaches, empowering them to elevate the standards of physical education
and sports coaching across Singapore schools. Their commitment to excellence
ultimately creates meaningful impact in students' lives whilst nurturing
their lifelong passion for physical activity and sport.</p>
