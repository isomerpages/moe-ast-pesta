<p>Jason Lum Tuck Choi has spent over two decades in education, growing alongside
colleagues and students at <strong>Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary)</strong>,
where he has served as a Physical Education educator, Subject Head, and
Lead Teacher. His professional journey has increasingly centered on strengthening
teacher learning — supporting educators in translating research-informed
pedagogies into practical classroom strategies that enhance student outcomes.</p>
<p>In 2023, Jason was conferred the <strong>Fellow of the Academy of Singapore Teachers</strong> award.
He regards this recognition not only as a milestone, but as a platform
for continued service to the teaching fraternity. It represents a responsibility
to contribute actively to professional conversations, mentor fellow educators,
and support the collective advancement of teaching practice across schools.</p>
<p>Through his involvement with <strong>PESTA</strong> and cluster networks,
Jason has facilitated professional learning experiences that integrate
Inquiry-Based Learning, Assessment for Learning, and purposeful EdTech
use. He sees professional growth as a collaborative endeavor where educators
engage in inquiry, reflect on practice, and refine their approaches based
on evidence of student learning.</p>
<h3>Bridging Research and Classroom Application Through Innovation</h3>
<p>A defining aspect of Jason's work is the commitment to bridging research
with classroom application, particularly in the area of <strong>Assessment for Learning</strong>.
He has explored how digital tools and AI affordances can make student thinking
more visible, enabling teachers to provide timely and actionable feedback.</p>
<p>For example, in his softball batting lessons, Jason experimented with <strong>AI-supported feedback tools</strong> to
help students analyze technique and reflect on performance. This approach
allowed assessment to move beyond observation toward deeper student self-awareness
and ownership of learning. Similarly, his use of the Learning Experience
Assistant within the <strong>Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong> has
supported both formative assessment and differentiated feedback, enabling
teachers to respond more effectively to diverse learning needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Innovation, in Jason's view, is not about adopting technology for its
own sake, but about enhancing pedagogical clarity and improving how we
respond to evidence of learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Assessment as a Driver of Professional Growth</h3>
<p>Jason’s belief in Assessment for Learning extends beyond students to professional
development itself. Whether working with teachers or students, he sees
assessment as a way to gauge understanding, refine approaches, and strengthen
effectiveness. Evidence of learning — shifts in teacher confidence, classroom
practice, or student engagement — provides valuable feedback that informs
his own growth as an educator.</p>
<p>Receiving the AST Fellowship in 2023 reinforced Jason's commitment to
serving the fraternity by creating professional spaces where teachers feel
supported to experiment, reflect, and grow. He believes that teacher development
thrives when grounded in trust, shared inquiry, and a collective purpose
to improve learning for students.</p>
