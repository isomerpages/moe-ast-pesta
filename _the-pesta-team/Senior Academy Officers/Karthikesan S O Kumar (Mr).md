Ms Milhan Binte Mahat started her teaching journey in Riverside Secondary School where she was given opportunities to head the Physical Education (PE) curriculum and sports leadership. Her daily interactions with students and colleagues inspired her to find out how best to design and implement a PE curriculum and student leadership programme that prepare future adults with values, skills and competencies that will make their life purposeful, meaningful and joyful.<br><br>
	
In students’ learning, she is interested to learn how students learn better with others (e.g. teachers, peers), by themselves (self-directed) and also find out what motivates them to want to learn and grow. She is also inspired to better her understanding on how an adult’s (e.g. teacher, coach, parents) behaviour impacts students’ learning and their motivation to learn for life.<br><br>

In June 2020, Ms Milhan joined PESTA to be part of the organisation's effort to partner educators in their journeys to sharpen their existing professional skills and competencies. She believes that these efforts are required to deliver quality PE and Sports programmes that remains relevant to the ever evolving educational landscape.</p>
