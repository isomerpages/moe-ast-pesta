Selvei graduated from NIE as a teacher specializing in the teaching of Science. However, her experiences at Marymount Convent School included the teaching of PE. She subsequently took up the role of Sports Secretary. When Selvei was posted to St Gabriel’s Primary School, she was given the opportunity to embark on the in-service Diploma in Physical Education. This opportunity equipped her with the set of knowledge and skills enabling her to expand her quest to continue a journey in the teaching of PE.<br><br>
	
PE has always been a fascinating subject for Selvei. She believes through PE, she can inspire the young and the old, engage them in pursuing a healthy lifestyle. This includes enjoyment in sports through a life-long pursuit. Selvei wants to be the difference in lives of other in this way.<br><br>

One of the beliefs in the Singapore Curriculum Philosophy, ‘Every child wants to learn and can learn’, has been the mantra for her. It had kept her focusing on pedagogical principles that utlize meaningful lessons to equip the students with joyful learning experiences. Every child is like a slab of clay that we need to skillfully mould.</p>
