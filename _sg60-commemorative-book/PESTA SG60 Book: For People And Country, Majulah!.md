<p>As Singapore marks her 60th year of independence, this book stands as
both a celebration and a commitment. “<em>For People and Country. Majulah!</em>”
brings together 60 powerful stories, one for every year of our nationhood.
Penned by 60 PE teachers across generations and profiles, these narratives
echo with perseverance, sacrifice, and unyielding hope. They are stories
of hardship, triumph, growth, and sacrifice – each a thread in the fabric
of our national story. These stories are not just about the past – they
are a call to action for the future. To continue nurturing hearts and minds;
to pass the torch not just in ceremony, but in daily practice.</p>
<p>Told through six themed chapters, the book journeys from the field to
the heart.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>The Mission: United for Glory</strong> – the unifying spirit of
sport, playing for something bigger than ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Legends: Heroes Among Us </strong>– teachers, coaches, and
students whose grit turns obstacles into opportunities.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>The Moments: Triumphs that Define</strong>&nbsp;– pivotal incidents
and quiet breakthroughs that transform lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Identity: Strength in Diversity</strong>&nbsp;– how a multicultural
Singapore finds common ground in learning, playing and competing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Lessons: Wisdom from the Field</strong>&nbsp;– resilience,
teamwork, and integrity carried beyond the court.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Legacy: Passing the Torch</strong>&nbsp;– honouring those
who came before and inspiring the next generation.</p>

</ul>
<p>As we honour six decades of Singapore’s journey – whether you are a teacher,
student, parent, athlete, or simply someone who believes in the power of
stories – we invite you to journey with us. May these stories move you,
challenge you, and inspire you to write and share your own.</p>
