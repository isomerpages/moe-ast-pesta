Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Teaching and Learning in Physical Education
=========================================================================================

**This book is designed to contribute to the continuing professional development (CPD) of practicing physical education teachers and supporting them to continue to earn and develop their teaching with a specific focus on how this impacts on and enhances students' learning.**


![CPD for Teaching and Learning Book Cover](/images/20220601_105525_resized.jpeg)

Throughout the book, teachers are encouraged not just to reflect on where they are now, but also what changes they intend to make to their practice, how they implement those changes and then to review the impact this has had on students' learning. Each chapter includes tasks embedded within the content to encourage the reader to reflect on how they could apply the new knowledge they are acquiring from reading and engaging with the chapter.

Written for a global audience, the book brings together examples from the Singapore Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA), which provides CPD to teachers in the high-performing Singaporean system. Offering high quality research and practice, this book is a pivotal resource for physical education teachers undertaking CPD all over the world.

Below is a resource list for readers to gain more perspectives for the respective chapter titles.

<ul>
<li>Gordon discusses the principles of adaptation which, when combined with creative approaches, can lead to successful inclusive experiences for both students and teachers.
