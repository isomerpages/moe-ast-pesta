Mr Chan Weng Kit, Mark began his career at Temasek Secondary School in June 1999, teaching Physical Education and Mathematics. He became the Physical Education (PE) Head of Department from 2002 to June 2005, before assuming school leadership positions in various secondary schools between June 2005 and Dec 2016. Mark joined the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) in January 2017. In August that same year, Mark went to pursue his Master of Arts (MA) in PE at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York, USA on a MOE Postgraduate Scholarship.<br><br>

Mark aspires to enable students of all abilities, from diverse backgrounds, to develop skills, nurture a love for PE and experience success in their unique ways in a safe, positive and purposeful learning environment. Mark also believes that students need to learn and experience the joy of learning. Education needs to be seen as providing a “lifting” effect to all students as teachers strive to develop each and every student to his or her fullest potential. <em><strong>L</strong>earning <strong>I</strong>s <strong>F</strong>un <strong>T</strong>ogether</em>.<br><br>
