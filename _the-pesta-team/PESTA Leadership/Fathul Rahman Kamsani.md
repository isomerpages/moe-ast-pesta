“Mia San Mia – We Are Who We Are”<br><br>

Mr Fathul Rahman’s journey as an educator began in 1997 at Tampines Secondary School. A passionate footballer and rugby player, he was involved in both sports in different capacities – as a teacher in-charge, coach, zonal and national convenor, and also as Team Manager for the Singapore Schools U-15 Football team. He continues to be involved with the two sports today as part of staying fit and keeping in contact with his friends and team-mates. The two things in life that are very important to him.<br><br>  
	
Prior to PESTA, Fathul was a Vice-Principal at Guangyang Secondary School. This is his second HQ stint after having completed a year as a Special Project Officer in Schools Division in 2005. He was HOD for PE & CCA at Tampines Secondary School from 1999 – 2004. A firm believer that students learn best through doing, he advocated for programmes that provided students with authentic learning experiences that help them develop important lifeskills and values. These include having lessons outside the classrooms and in the immediate school vicinity; rugged activities such as camps and expeditions, local and overseas learning journeys; engagement with the community through public service and public performances; and work attachment opportunities.<br><br>

At PESTA, Fathul intends to build on the good work of the pioneer team and the current team, and to continue to stay relevant and push the boundary for teaching and learning in PE so as to be of value to the PE fraternity and to the students in our schools.</p>
