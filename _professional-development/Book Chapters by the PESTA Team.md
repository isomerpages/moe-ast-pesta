Throughout the book, teachers are encouraged not just to reflect on where they are now, but also what changes they intend to make to their practice, how they implement those changes and then to review the impact this has had on students' learning. Each chapter includes tasks embedded within the content to encourage the reader to reflect on how they could apply the new knowledge they are acquiring from reading and engaging with the chapter.

Written for a global audience, the book brings together examples from the Singapore Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA), which provides CPD to teachers in the high-performing Singaporean system. Offering high quality research and practice, this book is a pivotal resource for physical education teachers undertaking CPD all over the world.

Below is a resource list for readers to gain more perspectives for the respective chapter titles.
