Mr Chen Yuliang started teaching Physical Education in Fuchun Secondary School from 2010 to 2014. In July 2015, he joined West Spring Secondary School as the Subject Head of Physical Education and CCA. Yuliang was privileged to be able to helm various portfolios in his stint in school. This allowed him to be able to embed his belief of “<em>Joy of Learning</em>”, “<em>Experiential Learning</em>” and “<em>Mens Sana in Corpore Sano</em>” into the school curriculum and many programs. He strongly believes on a holistic education and when it comes to PE lessons or school programs, students must actively engage their mind, body and heart.<br><br>

Additionally, he is a firm believer that students will be able to lead and initiate their own learning when they are inspired and empowered. In Fuchun Secondary School, his Camp Leaders were passionate about leadership and outdoors, evident from the fact that they came back generation after generation to facilitate the learning and selection process of their juniors in camps. In West Spring Secondary School, his students also went beyond the PE curriculum to start their own interest groups and initiated their own pick up sessions. These sessions eventually became training sessions where seniors who have graduated come back on to pass on their knowledge and skills to the young ones. Some even took on the role of coaches and team managers for local school competitions.<br><br>

Yuliang is currently involved with schools support and professional development workshops for Secondary School in PESTA. His sporting interests include basketball, handball and ultimate frisbee.</p>
