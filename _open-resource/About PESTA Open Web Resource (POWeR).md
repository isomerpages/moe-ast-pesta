<p>The<strong> P</strong>ESTA <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>We</strong>b <strong>R</strong>esource
(POWeR)<strong> </strong>was launched by Deputy Director-General of Education
(Professional Development), Ms Beatrice Chong, on 27 August 2024, during
PESTA's Professional Learning Fiesta.</p>
<p><em>"POWeR is essentially a one stop platform for our PE teachers to do self-directed professional learning. It is a repository to find many good resources such as podcast, vodcast, 21CC lesson ideas, Skills Future for Educators workshop resources."</em>
</p>
<p><em>"There will also be a global audience for POWeR. Hand on heart, PE is one of the subjects that has transformed the way it has approached its teaching and learning....Kudos to the Singapore PE teaching fraternity and there are also many things we can contribute to the global PE fraternity."</em>
</p>
<p>- Ms Beatrice Chong, Dy DGE, opening address for PESTA's Professional
Learning Fiesta.</p>
<p>PESTA aims to enrich the global repository of knowledge by offering sound
physical education (PE) resources, grounded in the exemplary standards
of the Singapore education system, the Singapore Physical Education Syllabus,
and the exceptional quality of workshops we conduct.</p>
<p>These resources will be disseminated through our <strong>P</strong>ESTA <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>We</strong>b <strong>R</strong>esource
(POWeR), a dedicated platform housed within the PESTA website and overseen
by our organisation. POWeR is designed to cater primarily to PE teachers
while remaining accessible to the broader public.</p>
<p>The resources, which centre on the six prioritised areas of practice outlined
in SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd), are curated by PESTA to ensure relevance
and effectiveness.</p>
