Senior Academy Officer

Prior to joining AST, Hui Chun has been with Peicai Secondary School as Head of Department of PE &amp; CCA for about 9 years. 

Hui Chun believes that quality relations bring about quality teaching and learning. This is applicable to both rapport between teachers and students (for quality lessons to take place), and also relationship amongst staff (for quality professional development to take place). Learning does not stop no matter how much experience you have in a particular field. One must uphold the right attitude and mindset in order to continue learning and improve in the teaching journey. 

Hui Chun enjoys spending time with her twin children, especially in outdoor activities, improving their psychomotor skills and exposing them to the various outdoor activities. In her own free time, she enjoys watching dramas on Netflix.
