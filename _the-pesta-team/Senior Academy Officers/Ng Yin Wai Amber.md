<h5>Ng Yin Wai Amber (Academy Officer)</h5><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 75%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/DSC_0191.JPG"></div><p>Amber Ng believes that education goes beyond teaching content and curriculum. She seeks to touch lives in special ways and to maximize the potential in each student. Her inspiration is simple, that is, to&nbsp;<em>“educate a child to bring out his greatest potential, so that he will grow up into a good man and useful citizen”.</em>&nbsp;Having served in the social services sector prior to teaching, she finds that the philosophies conflate where she grew to see education as an uplifting force, regardless of family background and abilities.</p><p>Her participation in competitive sports and PE in her student days has been instrumental in shaping her identity, values and advocacy, and she is thankful to her PE and CCA teachers for her being able to enjoy the current lifestyle of active and healthy living. Her own journey as a PE teacher started in Huamin Primary School, and as a firm believer that teaching is an art and a lifelong endeavour of learning, the interaction with students and colleagues impacted and led her to further her studies in the National Institute of Education (NIE), where she specialized in Special Education.</p><p>As a beneficiary of PESTA’s Beginning PE Teacher (BPET) network, Amber hopes to pay it forward by supporting BPETs and fellow PE colleagues in their professional growth.</p><p>Work aside, she volunteers with various non-profit organizations and ad hoc projects, where she seeks to use her knowledge in meaningful ways, as well as to continue learning through the interaction with others.</p>
