<p>Many general resources are openly available these days on the internet.
PESTA would like to add to the international body of knowledge by contributing
sound PE resources, based on high standards of the Singapore education
system, the Singapore Physical Education Syllabus and the quality workshops
that we conduct.</p>
<p>These resources will be shared here at our PESTA Open Resource Webpage
(PORW). PORW is a platform housed within PESTAâ€™s website managed by PESTA
and is accessible to the general public, with PE teachers as our specific
target audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resources focusing on the six prioritised areas of practice in SkillsFuture
for Educators (SFEd), are specially curated by PESTA.</p>
<p>Get in touch with our Team (email us at <a href="mailto:moe_pesta@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>moe_pesta@moe.gov.sg</u></a>) if
you have any queries or feedback.</p>
