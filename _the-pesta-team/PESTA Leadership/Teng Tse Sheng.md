<p style="text-align:justify">
Teng Tse Sheng started his teaching career in June 2000 at Serangoon Junior College (SRJC). He was the PE Head of Department from 2009 to 2011. During his time at SRJC, Tse Sheng coached the college football team for 11 years, and was also the assistant coach for the Singapore Schools Under-17 Football Team in 2005 and 2006. He joined the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) as a Programme Manager in 2012. In 2014, Tse Sheng was awarded the MOE Postgraduate Scholarship to pursue his Master of Education at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada. Tse Sheng has a keen interest in games-teaching pedagogies, in particular the Game Centred Approach and the Inventing Games Model. Upon his return from his studies, he started a Game Centred Approach Community of Practice, where a group of teachers practising this approach meet regularly to share ideas.<br><br>
	
Tse Sheng was appointed as Master Teacher in 2016, and has been working closely with schools to investigate how games can be taught more effectively and meaningfully. Tse Sheng firmly believes that ‘teachers can learn a lot from their students, and that students are our teachers as well’.<br><br>

It is this belief that led him to conduct the research with ST PE from Outram Sec and Serangoon Garden Sec on how students perceive PE. He believes that by giving students a voice, teachers will understand their students better and enable teachers to design a more student centric PE lesson. Students are also empowered to co-create a more meaningful and enjoyable learning experience. This focus on student centricity led him to successfully modify the shuttlecock to slow down its flight. This first-of-its-kind innovation makes learning to play badminton easier for the low progressed learners.</p>
