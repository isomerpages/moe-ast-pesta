<p><em>Prior to joining AST, </em><strong><em>WEE BOON NEE </em></strong><em>has been with River Vally Primary School for 10 years (as Head of Department (PE) for 5 years) and &nbsp;Dazhong Primary School as Head of Department (PE) &nbsp;for 12 years and Lead Teacher (PE) for 6 years. &nbsp;</em>

<p><strong><em>WEE BOON NEE </em></strong>believes strongly in teachers as
role-models for teaching and learning. Regardless of their years in service
and experience, everyone brings with them different expertise and learning
dispositions which others can learn from. Adopting the correct learning
disposition should be the key focus which would lead to a positive outcome.
Whilst we want students to develop the joy of learning, teachers should
also develop and experience the joy of teaching by adopting a growth mindset
and equipping themselves with the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes.</p>

<p><strong><em>WEE BOON NEE </em></strong><em>loves to play badminton in his free time. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, he would play badminton twice a week and cycle occasionally along park connectors. He enjoys listening to instrumental music which helps him to relax and stay focus while working.</em>
