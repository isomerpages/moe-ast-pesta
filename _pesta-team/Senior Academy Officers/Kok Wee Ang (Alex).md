<p>Prior to joining PESTA, I taught in Northbrooks Secondary School for 12
years. I worked with student leaders and developed the school’s Learn for
Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education as Subject Head Student Leadership
&amp; Outdoor Education for 4 years. For the efforts in student leadership
and outdoor education, I was a recipient of the Outstanding Youth in Education
Award (OYEA) in 2020. During this period, I led the team in conceptualizing
the inaugural National Orienteering Race (Schools) and partnered with Mandai
Wildlife Reserves to create a Zoo Orienteering Race which obtained an Innergy
Bronze Award in 2021.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I took on the role of Head of Department of Physical Education
and Co-Curricular Activities for 3 years. This period allowed me to chart
the professional learning journey of my PE team in E-pedagogy and 21CC
development, which culminated in sharing at local and overseas conferences.
The next chapter of adventure was to pursue a Master of Science in Outdoor
Education at the University of Edinburgh before joining PESTA!</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs and Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<p>I’m a strong advocate for experiential learning as I believe it is learning
that will last the distance for our students. Through many areas of my
work, the promotion of student ownership, agency and advocacy is strongly
aligned with the philosophy of challenge by choice.</p>
<p>At the organizational level, we offer students rich learning opportunities
by adopting inter-disciplinary thinking and synergistic partnerships. These
partnerships enhance student experience by providing real-life contexts,
developing global awareness and cross-cultural literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Education, Sports and Outdoors</strong>
</p>
<p>I believe that Physical Education affords our students a platform to develop
critical and adaptive thinking across various sports and games. Sports
can inculcate values like integrity, teamwork and sportsmanship in our
youth, which will stay with them for life.&nbsp; The beautiful natural
environment that mother nature provides allows our students to traverse
and understand our local landscapes. The skills and attitudes attained
outdoors by our students provide catalysts for environmental conservation
in our country.</p>
